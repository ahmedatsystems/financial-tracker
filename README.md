i want to build an email automation app which scans my email for bank mails and uses ai to see what the expenses were, at what place and puts them into a category. basically a financial tracker via email. what would be the best approach to build this with good ui and keeping in mind that deployment should be very easy. 
lets say that since all the bank emails are by just the bank,  so instead of figuring out which email is from the bank from all the mails, the user just gives the address that the emails come from
This project is a smart, email-based financial tracker that connects to a user's Gmail account using OAuth, scans only emails from user-specified bank sender addresses (e.g., alerts@hdfcbank.net), and automatically extracts transaction details such as amount, merchant, date, and transaction type (debit or credit) using a combination of AI (OpenAI's GPT API) and rule-based parsing (regex). These transactions are then categorized (e.g., Food, Bills, Shopping) and stored in a secure database, allowing users to view their spending through a clean, responsive dashboard featuring tables, charts, and category summaries. The app includes features like manual or scheduled syncing, editable categories, transaction filters, and CSV export, with all user data encrypted and privacy-conscious. The goal is to give users a fully automated, zero-effort personal expense tracker built directly on top of the financial alerts they already receive via email, deployed with modern, scalable tools like React (frontend), Node.js or FastAPI (backend), Supabase (database), and Vercel/Render (deployment).
